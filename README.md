# CTA Ridership Analysis Application

This repository contains a Python application for in-depth analysis of ridership data of the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) 'L' trains. It provides multiple functionalities for users to interactively explore, analyze, and visualize the CTA ridership data.

## Tech Stack

- **Python:** The entire application logic is developed using Python, leveraging its robust libraries for data handling and analysis.
- **SQLite:** SQLite is used for data storage and manipulation, providing efficient and secure access to the CTA ridership dataset.
- **Matplotlib:** Data visualizations are implemented using Matplotlib, providing interactive and detailed graphical representations of the data.

## Functionalities

The application offers the following functionalities to explore and analyze the CTA ridership data:

1. **retrieve_stations**: Outputs all station names.
2. **output_ridership**: Outputs the total ridership for each 'L' line.
3. **top_ten_busiest**: Outputs the 10 busiest stations.
4. **least_ten_busiest**: Outputs the 10 least busy stations.
5. **line_color_stops**: Outputs all stations for a given line color.
6. **ridership_by_month**: Outputs the average daily ridership per month for a given year.
7. **ridership_by_year**: Outputs the average daily ridership for a given year.
8. **compare_ridership**: Compares the daily ridership of two stations for a given year.
9. **line_color_plot**: Outputs all station names that are part of a specific line, in ascending order, and provides an option to plot them on a map.

## Usage
